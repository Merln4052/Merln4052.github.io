        <p>These sharks are known by oter names aside from just Oceanic White Tip,known as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, Brown shark, Nigano shark, Oceanic white-tipped whaler, and Silvertip shark, is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting tropical and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.</p> 
        <p>Wikipedia</p> 
        <p>It is bronze, <span style="color:brown">brown</span>, <span style="color:blue">bluish</span> or <span style="color:grey">grey</span> dorsally (the colour varies by region), and has a white underbelly. The oceanic whitetip shark is a medium-sized requiem shark. The largest specimen ever caught measured 13 ft, an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of 9.8 ft. The maximum reported weight is 370 lb. The female is typically larger than the male by 3.9 in. Males attain sexual maturity at 5.6 to 6.2 ft and females about 5.9 to 6.6 ft. A requiem shark is a migratory, livebearing shark of warm seas, sometimes also found in brackish or fresh water.Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and caudal) have white tips (juvenile specimens and some adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and in young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins.The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular (somewhat fang-like). There are between 13 and 15 teeth on either side of the symphysis joint.The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edgesâ€”there are 14 or 15 along each side of the symphysis joint. The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges.</p>
